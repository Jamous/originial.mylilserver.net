        <h3>MyLilServer.net</h3>
        MyLilServer.net is an ongoing project. I will continue to add too the site as new ideas come to me, but for night now it is more a proof of concept then anything else.

        <h3>WVRU Catalog server</h3>
        WVRU, Radford University's public radio station, has a jazz cd colection of roughly 3,000 CDs. At this time the majority of the CDs are cataloged, but that catalog is spread across several excel documents,
        making the catalog virtualy imposible to search. The prupose of this project are as follows.

        <ul>
            <li>Hold the Artist name, Album Name, Record Lable, Year released, genera, and a short discreption of the song in an SQL database.</li>
            <li>Write a program to take the existing records, convert them into a relational database friendly format, and upload them to the database.</li>
            <li>Be easily able to querry the database.</li>
            <li>Build a Web interface that can query the database. The end user should never have to use any SQL comands.</li>
            <li>Build a managment front end that allows an end user to add and edit entries without having to use SQL comands.</li>
            <li>Privately host the system on a Ubuntu 18.04 LTS platform, allowing me to pass it on to Radford Universitys IT department, once i am done building it, to permantly deploy it.</li>
        </ul>
            
        While there is currently nothing on the website, you can access that machine at <a href="http://wvru.mylilserver.net">wvru.mylilserver.net</a>.<br> I will update this page with my progress on that project.

        <h3>Old ePortfolio</h3>
        This is an ePortfolio I wrote from scratch for web development 1, at New River Community College in the fall of 2017. It is very old, and outdated but it is stil my old website.

    <a id="calculator">
        <h3>Mortgage Calculator</h3>
        This was a group project from web-desgin 1, where as a team we had to build a webpage that would accept user input that would include the <i>principal</i>, <i>Intrest rate</i>, <i>time elapsed</i>,
        and the <i>monthly payment</i> made on the loan. As a group we made 2 versions, one where intrest would compound monthly, and one where intrest would compound daily. Links to both can be found bellow.
